- Changes in the Website after Deployment:
  
  After deploying version 1, a small change was made to index.php by adding a marquee element (having "Every donor is a hero. Register now!"), and version 2 was created. As a result, after the rolling update, this marquee is visible on the website. When rolled back, the it is removed, restoring the previous version.
